# LegoUltrasound by Weiting Tan 
**from 2019/05/21
Summer Research at Hopkins under Professor Emad Boctor**

Start with Matlab code, completing simulation based on different phantoms (using K-wave software).
With data retrieved from the simulation, use python to process and analyze with neural network
Try to decrease the # of elements used in the transducer to increase the flexibility of current probes => "LEGO" like ultrasound probe
